# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 2, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Solved this LeetCode challenge using Linear search to find the smallest value in an array. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled to remember code flow in the beginning but quickly caught back up. A lot of this was instinctual which was good. Accounting for all the possible test cases was a struggle. I need to work more on time complexity.
