# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 2, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Solved this LeetCode challenge using Linear search to find the smallest value in an array. 

**Thoughts:** I struggled to remember code flow in the beginning but quickly caught back up. A lot of this was instinctual which was good. Accounting for all the possible test cases was a struggle. I need to work more on time complexity.

### Day 2: September 2, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Yup, so it may look like the same day, but for me this is technically my second day of the challenge; just roll with it. Started working on a project where I can build my own app that uses Google Translate API to translate any language. I don't have a finished project yet but I did discover GoogleAppsScript and created my own script that interacts with the Google Translate Api.  

**Thoughts:** This was a really cool way to learn about some more tools I can add to my developer toolbox. I'm amazed that this works; but I'm enjoying it so far! There's still some more work I have to do to include this script in a working project and test; I'll share what that looks like once I'm done.

### Day 3: September 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: I continued building a translation application using GoogleAppsScript. Today was a great day for review on topics such as encoding a URL in Java and making a Http request.  

**Thoughts:** I hit a small snag with making my app work today; as I had some errors when I ran the application. This was frustrating but no application usually works on the first try; I'll try again tomorrow.
